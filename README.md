### What I learned

Something I learned in this lesson was how to utilize the `@font-face` rule to load my font in my stylesheet. Typically, I link it in the `<head>` of my HTML document, but doing it this way allows me to load it through a local file.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: Figtree;
    src: url('/assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype')
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to learn ways that I can make my CSS more efficient by accomplishing the same task with less code.
